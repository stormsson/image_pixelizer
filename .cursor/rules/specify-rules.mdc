# pixelizer Development Guidelines

Auto-generated from all feature plans. Last updated: 2025-11-22

## Active Technologies
- Python 3.11+ + PySide6 (Qt6 bindings), Pillow (PIL) for image processing, NumPy for efficient pixel manipulation, SAM (Segment Anything Model) for image segmentation, torch/torchvision for SAM model loading and inference (002-image-operations)
- File system (save processed images as PNG files; no database or persistent state required). SAM model files cached locally after first download. (002-image-operations)
- Python 3.11+ + PySide6 (Qt6 bindings), Pillow (PIL) for image processing, NumPy for efficient pixel manipulation, rembg for AI-powered background removal (002-image-operations)
- File system (save processed images as PNG files; no database or persistent state required). Operation history maintained in memory during session. (002-image-operations)
- Python 3.11+ + PySide6 (GUI framework), NumPy (image processing), Pillow (PIL) for image I/O (004-photo-editing-tools)
- In-memory image data processing, no persistent storage required (004-photo-editing-tools)

- Python 3.11+ + PySide6 (Qt6 bindings), Pillow (PIL) for image processing, NumPy for efficient pixel manipulation (001-image-pixelizer)
